Could use this regex to check if the word starts with a vowel?

\s[aeiou]+

split phrase by /s
base case 
if currWord == phraseArray.length() return 
if /s[aeiou] (return word + yay)


for each loop
return index of first vowel
if firstvowelindex =0 then return userWord + yay
else
get substring starting at firstvowel index
get substring 0-firstvowel index
concat substring a + substring b +"ay"

punctuation
if word.contains(.,!?) 
return index of it by search(.,!?)
if index == word.length -1 then append string with charAt.(word.length()-1)
also have to take out the old charat... return pigword inside the if statement first substring truncated
else normal pigword

theres something where you can split the word at regex, then can put the second split part to the end of pig word?

are conditional statements only useful for assigning variables? I tried to use one to print something out if a condition was true but couldn't figure out how
the four expressions that can take regex as an argument on the string method are SPLIT REPLACEFIRST MATCHES REPLACEALL
